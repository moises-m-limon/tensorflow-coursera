This will make a 1 bedroom house cost 100k, a 2 bedroom house cost 150k etc.\n","\n","How would you create a neural network that learns this relationship so that it would predict a 7 bedroom house as costing close to 400k etc.\n","\n","Hint: Your network might work better if you scale the house price down. You don't have to give the answer 400...it might be better to create something that predicts the number 4, and then your answer is in the 'hundreds of thousands' etc."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"deletable":false,"editable":false,"id":"ppbPvuw6VlAp","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1686115888600,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":5,"user":{"displayName":"Moises Limon","userId":"07026156694348080515"}},"outputId":"9a51cd22-fc1b-4758-ac9c-58cf2cdabdd0","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["python3: can't open file '/content/add_metadata.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory\n"]}],"source":["# IMPORTANT: This will check your notebook's metadata for grading.\n","# Please do not continue the lab unless the output of this cell tells you to proceed.\n","!python add_metadata.py --filename C1W1_Assignment.ipynb"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"gx95jlsKVlAq"},"source":["_**NOTE:** To prevent errors from the autograder, you are not allowed to edit or delete non-graded cells in this notebook .
