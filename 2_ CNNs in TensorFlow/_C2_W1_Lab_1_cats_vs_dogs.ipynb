You'll follow these steps:\n","\n","1.   Explore the example data of `Dogs vs. Cats`\n","2.   Build and train a neural network to classify between the two pets\n","3.

These generators will yield batches of images of size 150x150 and their labels (binary).\n","\n","As you may already know, data that goes into neural networks should usually be normalized in some way to make it more amenable to processing by the network (i.e. It is uncommon to feed raw pixels into a ConvNet.) In this case, you will preprocess the images by normalizing the pixel values to be in the `[0, 1]` range (originally all values are in the `[0, 255]` range).\n","\n","In Keras, this can be done via the `keras.preprocessing.image.ImageDataGenerator` class using the `rescale` parameter. This `ImageDataGenerator` class allows you to instantiate generators of augmented image batches (and their labels) via `.flow(data, labels)` or `.flow_from_directory(directory)`."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":12,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":370,"status":"ok","timestamp":1700013863207,"user":{"displayName":"Moises Limon","userId":"07026156694348080515"},"user_tz":360},"id":"ClebU9NJg99G","outputId":"ca113547-6f97-456b-863d-882eee8651c7"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Found 2000 images belonging to 2 classes.\n","Found 1000 images belonging to 2 classes.\n"]}],"source":["from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator\n","\n","# All images will be rescaled by 1./255.\n","train_datagen = ImageDataGenerator( rescale = 1.0/255. )\n","test_datagen  = ImageDataGenerator( rescale = 1.0/255. )\n","\n","# --------------------\n","# Flow training images in batches of 20 using train_datagen generator\n","# --------------------\n","train_generator = train_datagen.flow_from_directory(train_dir,\n","                                                    batch_size=20,\n","                                                    class_mode='binary',\n","                                                    target_size=(150, 150))\n","# --------------------\n","# Flow validation images in batches of 20 using test_datagen generator\n","# --------------------\n","validation_generator =  test_datagen.flow_from_directory(validation_dir,\n","                                                         batch_size=20,\n","                                                         class_mode  = 'binary',\n","                                                         target_size = (150, 150))\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"mu3Jdwkjwax4"},"source":["### Training\n","You will now train on all 2,000 images available, for 15 epochs, and monitor the accuracy as well on the 1,000 images in the validation set.\n","\n","Do note the values per epoch.\n","\n","You'll see 4 values per epoch -- Loss, Accuracy, Validation Loss and Validation Accuracy.\n","\n","The `loss` and `accuracy` are great indicators of progress in training. `loss` measures the current model prediction against the known labels, calculating the result. `accuracy`, on the other hand, is the portion of correct guesses.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"Fb1_lgobv81m","outputId":"76260b30-39a3-4bd2-ad94-df52f4056193"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Epoch 1/15\n"]}],"source":["history = model.fit(\n","            train_generator,\n","            epochs=15,\n","            validation_data=validation_generator,\n","            verbose=2\n","            )"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"o6vSHzPR2ghH"},"source":["### Model Prediction\n","\n","Now take a look at actually running a prediction using the model.

Overfitting happens when a model exposed to too few examples learns patterns that do not generalize to new data, i.e. when the model starts using irrelevant features for making predictions. For instance, if you, as a human, only see three images of people who are lumberjacks, and three images of people who are sailors, and among them the only person wearing a cap is a lumberjack, you might start thinking that wearing a cap is a sign of being a lumberjack as opposed to a sailor. You would then make a pretty lousy lumberjack/sailor classifier.\n","\n","Overfitting is the central problem in machine learning: given that you are fitting the parameters of our model to a given dataset, how can you make sure that the representations learned by the model will be applicable to data it has never seen before?
